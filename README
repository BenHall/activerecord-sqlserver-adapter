INSTALL
=======

gem install akitaonrails-activerecord-sqlserver-adapter --source=http://gems.github.com

EXAMPLE
=======
database.yml
adapter: sqlserver 
host: localhost
database: master
username: sa
password: p@ssw0rd

OSX SUPPORT
===========
I was unable to get this working on OSX due to a dependency on Win32OLE. I did however have this working with ActiveRecord on Windows 7.

For OSX and Microsoft SQL Server, I recommend looking at IronRuby which has built-in support.
